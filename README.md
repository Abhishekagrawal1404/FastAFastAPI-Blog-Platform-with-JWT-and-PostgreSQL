This is a FastAPI app that provides a RESTful API for a blog platform. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts and comments. It also implements authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

## Features

- User registration and login using email and password
- JWT token generation and verification for authentication and authorization
- CRUD endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts and comments
- PostgreSQL database integration using SQLAlchemy as the ORM
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## Prerequisites
